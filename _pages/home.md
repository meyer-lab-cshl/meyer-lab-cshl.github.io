            The immune system must be able to distinguish between self and non-self in order
            to both effectively fight infection, and prevent autoimmune diseases. The T cells
            of the vertebrate immune system learn to maintain this balance during their
            development in the thymus.
        </p>
        <p>
            We study how the organisation of the thymus and its cells provide an
            effective education system for T cells. We are particularly interested how the
            interactions of developing T cells and thymic epithelial cells lead to
            tolerance induction and generation of diversity in the immune system.

            The Meyer Lab seeks to answer these questions by combining genomics,
            quantitative genetics and <i>in silico</i> thymic selection models.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our current research focuses on understanding the regulation of promiscuous gene expression in the
            human and mouse thymus, determining the genetic and epigenetic drivers of
            thymocyte development and differentiation and developing a comprehensive
            model of central tolerance induction.
