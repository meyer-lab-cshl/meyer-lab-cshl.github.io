        The immune system must be able to distinguish between self and non-self in order
        to both effectively fight infection, and prevent autoimmune diseases. The T cells
        of the vertebrate immune system learn to maintain this balance during their
        development in the thymus.

        We study how the organisation of the thymus and its cells provide an
        effective education system for T cells. We are particularly interested how the
        interactions of developing T cells and thymic epithelial cells lead to
        tolerance induction and generation of diversity in the immune system.

        The Meyer Lab seeks to answer these questions by combining genomics and mathematical modelling.
        We investigate the spatial and temporal organisation of promiscuous gene expression in the thymus
        and how antigen distribution in the thymus affects epithelial-T cell interaction and migration.
        To understand cellular integrity mechanisms in thymic epithelial cells,
        we conduct research on the spatio-temporal organisation of promiscuous gene expression on a per-cell
        level.
