        In the thymus, blood-borne T cell progenitors interact with thymic epithelial cells (TECs)
        to select for T cells with functional T cell receptors (positive selection) and select
        against T cells that show a strong binding to self-antigens (negative selection).
        Positive selection takes place on cortical TECs, whereas negative selection largely
        depends on the antigen-presentation of TECs in the thymic medulla. Collectively, these
        medullary TECs express over 85% of all protein coding genes, while each antigen
        is expressed by a fraction of cells. This phenomenon, termed promiscuous gene expression,
        imposes T cell tolerance by making self-antigens, which are otherwise expressed in
        a spatially or temporally restricted manner, continuously accessible to developing T cells.

        We study how promiscuous gene expression is organised on a
        tissue-wide level using genomics combined with computational simulations

        Central T cell tolerance relies on the thymic epithelium to present peripheral
        proteins to developing T cells. However, it remains unknown how thymic
        epithelial cells maintain their integrity despite expressing peripheral
        proteins that may interfere with epithelial-specific pathways and roles.

        We are interested in understanding the impact of promiscuous gene expression on
        cell integrity and investigate potential mechanisms to cope with the increased
        expression of non-epithelial proteins.
