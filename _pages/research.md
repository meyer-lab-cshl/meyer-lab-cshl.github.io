        The immune system exists in an intricate balance. Inappropriate response
        to the body’s own antigens leads to autoimmunity. In contrast, lack of
        appropriate response to foreign invaders results in immunodeficiency.
        The thymus plays a key role in establishing this balance by presenting
        the body’s self-antigens to developing T cells in a process called central tolerance induction.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Meyer lab studies how the organisation of the thymus and the cells therein
        contribute to successful T cell development leading to a competent
        immune system with adequate effector function.

        Within the thymus, T cell progenitors known as thymocytes interact with
        thymic epithelial cells to select for T cells with functional T cell receptors
        and against T cells that bind strongly to self-antigens.
        The latter, negative selection process that induces central tolerance largely
        depends on antigen presentation in the thymic
        medulla. Medullary thymic epithelial cells express nearly all peripheral
        antigens, representing essentially all tissues of the body.
        T cells that react to these peripheral
        self-antigens are removed to ensure that no autoimmune responses occur.
        There are many open questions regarding this extraordinary process, from the
        molecular factors responsible for this promiscuous gene expression, to the tissue-level
        regulation of the thymic epithelial cells driving it. Many of these questions
        hinge on the impact of regulation on the thymic selection process.
        </p>
        <p>We study the regulation of thymic gene expression in human and mouse
        thymus, both on molecular and tissue-wide level to understand the
        diversity and structure of the antigen space available for T cell
        education.

        In the thymus, T cell progenitors give rise to a variety of T cell lineages,
        an intricate process tightly regulated by the combination of environmental
        signals, transcription factors as well as genetic and epigenetic
        factors.
        </p>
        <p>
        We combine experimental and high-throughput sequencing approaches to
        study the role of genetic and epigenetic factors in regulating thymocytes
        development and differentiation.

        Thymus biology has been well characterized in qualitative terms:
        the developmental stages of thymocytes and thymic epithelium based on the
        expression of surface markers are well-known, and key molecular players like
        Aire and Fezf2 have been identified. In addition, quantitative aspects of the
        development process have been described: thymocytes spend about 4-5 days in the
        thymic medulla making 500-2000 contacts with antigen-presenting cells, and the
        percentage of antigens expressed in the mTEC population reaches about 85%.
        Despite these major achievements, a comprehensive understanding of how these
        aspects and thymic gene regulation integrate to achieve immune balance is missing.
        To efficiently explore the thymic education process, we are developing an
        in silico model of the thymus. This computational system allows us to
        explicitly model the interactions between T cells and thymic epithelial cells
        and gain insight into how an effective, yet self-tolerant, immune system is developed.
