            <strong>Hannah Meyer</strong><br>
            Hannah is an Assistant Professor and the lab’s principal
            investigator. She received a B.Sc. and M.Sc. from Heidelberg
            University before she started her Ph.D. in Ewan Birney's research
            group at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), University
            of Cambridge. After graduation, Hannah started her independent
            research group at CSHL.

            <strong>Amitava Banerjee</strong><br>
            Amitava is a joint postdoctoral fellow in  the Meyer and Navlakha
            labs. He received his PhD in Physics from the University of Maryland
            and currently studies how T cells learn to differentiate between self
            and foreign peptides to mount immune responses against pathogens
            while avoiding autoimmune reactions.

            Yong is a Postdoctoral Fellow. He received a Ph.D. in Immunology
            from Baylor College of Medicine. In the Meyer Lab, he studies how
            genetic polymorphisms influence pediatric T cell development and
            predisposition to immune-mediated diseases in adulthood.

            <strong>Rishvanth Prabakar</strong><br>
        Rish is a postdoctoral fellow. He studies the interaction between T cells
        and epitelial cells in the thymus to understand the process of negative
        selection which helps prevent auto immunity. He was previously trained in
        molecular and computational biology focusing on single cell genomics
        at the University of Southern California.
