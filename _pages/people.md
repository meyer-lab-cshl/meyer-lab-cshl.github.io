            <strong>Hannah Meyer, CSHL Fellow</strong><br>
            Hannah is the labâ€™s principal investigator.
            She received a B.Sc. and M.Sc. from Heidelberg University before she started her Ph.D.
            in Ewan Birney's research group at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI),
            University of Cambridge. After graduation, Hannah started her independent research
            group at CSHL.
