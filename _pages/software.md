            <a href="https://hannahvmeyer.github.io/PhenotypeSimulator/">PhenotypeSimulator</a><br>
            R/CRAN framework for simulating genotype to phenotype relationships. It can
            model multiple traits with multiple underlying genetic loci as well as complex
            covariate and observational noise structure. This package has been designed
            to work with many common genetic tools both for input and
            output.<br>

            <a href="https://hannahvmeyer.github.io/plinkQC/">plinkQC</a><br>
            R/CRAN package for common genotype quality control steps. It provides
            an easily applicable workflow from per-individual and per-marker quality
            control to the generation of the  new, quality-controlled dataset.
            The outcomes of each quality control step are summarised in a quality
            control report.<br>

            Python module for computationally efficient joint genetic analysis of
            high-dimensional phenotypes, using linear mixed models with bootstrapping.
